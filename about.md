My name is Paulo Marques da Costa. I work out of my home office in Chandler/AZ as a Software Engineer within the storage team at Microsoft after passing through other great teams as well, such as Premier Field Engineer (Services) and Program Manager in Azure CAT (Customer Advisory Team), helping customers to be successful in Azure and at the same time helping Microsoft to provide the best cloud services.
